The server is running at **http://localhost:3000**

## What You Can Do Now:

### 1. **Upload 3D Models** 
- Drag 3D model files to the left drawer: **GLB, GLTF, FBX, OBJ, PLY, STL**
- Try the sample gearbox model that loads automatically
- Click on parts to focus and isolate them
- Use explode and slice controls

### 2. **Upload Content**
- Drag PDF, PNG, or JPG files to the right drawer
- Navigate through PDF pages with controls
- Zoom in and out on content
- Switch between different uploaded files

### 3. **Record Lessons**
- Click the red record button in the header
- Interact with both the 3D model and content
- Narrate your lesson while manipulating objects
- Stop recording and play back your lesson

### 4. **Explore Features**
- **Collapsible Drawers**: Toggle asset panels on/off
- **Asset Management**: Upload, switch, and delete files
- **3D Interactions**: Rotate, zoom, explode, slice, focus
- **Content Navigation**: Page controls, zoom, pan

## Test Files You Can Use:

### 3D Models (GLB/GLTF/FBX/OBJ/PLY/STL)
- **GLB/GLTF**: Download from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models?features=downloadable&sort_by=-likeCount) or [Khronos Sample Models](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models)
- **FBX**: From Autodesk Maya, 3ds Max, or Blender exports
- **OBJ**: Universal format from any 3D software
- **PLY/STL**: Great for 3D scanned models and 3D printing files

### Content Files
- **PDFs**: Any PDF document, technical manuals, textbooks
- **Images**: PNG or JPG files, diagrams, charts, photos

## Getting Started:

0. ``` npm start ```
