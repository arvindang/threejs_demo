- **Good Callback Architecture**: Systems communicate through well-defined callbacks
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy API is maintained through delegation
- **Proper Resource Management**: Most systems handle cleanup appropriately

### ⚠️ **Areas Needing Improvement**
- **Manual System Coordination**: Viewer3D manually orchestrates all systems
- **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Some systems lack comprehensive error boundaries
- **Performance Gaps**: Continuous rendering and memory usage could be optimized
- **Testing Coverage**: Missing automated testing for system interactions
- **Configuration Scatter**: Hardcoded values spread across multiple files

### 🔧 **Recommended Immediate Actions**
1. **Implement SystemCoordinator** - Central event bus for cleaner system communication
2. **Add Comprehensive Error Handling** - Prevent system crashes from propagating
3. **Create Performance Monitoring** - Track and optimize resource usage
4. **Implement Automated Testing** - Ensure system reliability during changes

## 🎯 Success Metrics to Track

- Time to upload and set up a lesson (target: < 5 minutes)
- Recording accuracy and sync quality
- User engagement with 3D vs 2D content
- Cross-browser compatibility score
- Performance on various devices
- User satisfaction with selection/navigation
