# Interactive 3D Learning Platform - Development TODO

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status
- âœ… Basic Three.js 3D viewer with GLB/GLTF loading
- âœ… Object isolation/focus functionality (needs improvement)
- âœ… Recording system with audio and interaction capture
- âœ… Playback with timeline controls
- âœ… Explode and slice view controls
- âœ… Basic UI with Bootstrap styling
- âœ… **Two-pane layout with collapsible drawers**
- âœ… **Multi-file drag-and-drop upload system**
- âœ… **Asset management for 3D models and content**
- âœ… **PDF viewer with PDF.js integration**
- âœ… **Image viewer with zoom controls**
- âœ… **Content navigation (pages, zoom)**

## ðŸš€ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (COMPLETED âœ…)

### File Management System
- âœ… **Multi-file Upload Interface**
  - âœ… Drag-and-drop zone for GLB/GLTF files
  - âœ… Drag-and-drop zone for assets (PDF, PNG, JPG, etc.)
  - âœ… File validation and error handling
  - âœ… Progress indicators for uploads

- âœ… **Asset Storage & Management**
  - âœ… Local storage/IndexedDB for file persistence
  - âœ… Asset preview thumbnails
  - âœ… Delete/rename functionality

### Two-Pane UI System
- âœ… **Layout Restructure**
  - âœ… Split-screen layout (3D viewer | Content viewer)
  - âœ… Responsive design for different screen sizes
  - âœ… Collapsible sidebar drawers for asset selection
  - âœ… Proper aspect ratio maintenance

- âœ… **3D Pane Enhancements**
  - âœ… Asset selector drawer (list of uploaded 3D models)
  - âœ… Model switching without page reload
  - âœ… Loading states and error handling

- âœ… **Content Pane Implementation**
  - âœ… PDF viewer integration (PDF.js)
  - âœ… Image viewer with zoom/pan
  - âœ… Asset selector drawer
  - âœ… Navigation controls (next/prev slide, page numbers)

## ðŸŽ® Phase 2: Interaction Improvements (Priority: HIGH)

### 3D Object Selection Fixes
- âœ… **Selection Sensitivity**
  - âœ… Implement click threshold/delay to prevent accidental selection, or notice if drag is happening, and prevent click (when rotating and not trying to select)
  - âœ… Add visual hover states before selection

- âœ… **Focus/Isolation Improvements**
  - âœ… Center selected object properly in view
  - âœ… Smooth camera transitions to focused object
  - âœ… Visual indicators for isolated state
  - âœ… Breadcrumb navigation (Full View > Part Name)

### Recording Enhancements
- [ ] **Multi-Pane Recording**
  - [ ] Capture both 3D interactions AND content pane state
  - [ ] Sync timestamps between both panes
  - [ ] Record content pane navigation (slide changes, zoom, etc.)
  - [ ] Handle switching between different assets during recording

- [ ] **Interaction Tracking**
  - [ ] Mouse click coordinates and targets
  - [ ] Camera position and rotation changes
  - [ ] Object selection/isolation events
  - [ ] Content pane scroll/zoom/navigation events
  - [ ] Timestamp all interactions with high precision
